IDEAS TO IMPROVE SCRIPT:

For Input Files: have users create a text or CSV file with the name of the beetle(s) found in each IDTrackerAI run as well as
the list of all coordinates for each filter paper polygon. Code will then automatically parse and assign those coordinates to the correct polygon. (one master list?)

Batch process this python code so that we can have an HPC process every beetle at once -> Then make a script that compiles all times into one singular file? 

We can make an alternative script that ANDS three polygons: useful if we don't care which shape a beetle is on, but rather we care time spent on ANY and ALL of the polygons:
simply add each shape together.
